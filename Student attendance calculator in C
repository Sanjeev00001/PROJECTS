The Student Attendance Calculator is a tool designed to simplify the process of tracking and managing student attendance in educational settings. Whether you're a teacher, school administrator, or even a student, this tool helps to ensure accurate attendance records and makes it easy to calculate attendance percentages over time.

Key Benefits:
Efficiency: Instead of manually calculating attendance percentages for each student, this tool automates the process, saving time and reducing human error.
Customization: You can adjust the number of classes and input custom date ranges, making it adaptable to different academic calendars or classroom schedules.
Threshold Monitoring: The tool also helps monitor whether students meet attendance requirements (such as a 75% minimum), which is often crucial for exams or certifications.
Scalability: This calculator can be used for individual students or scaled up to handle attendance data for an entire class or multiple classes.
By importing class attendance data, or entering it manually, the tool can instantly compute attendance rates, allowing for quick decision-making regarding student eligibility or performance. Additionally, it provides an easy way to export the data, which can be useful for school reporting or archiving purposes.

This project aims to be a straightforward, user-friendly solution that enhances the way attendance is calculated and tracked, improving both accuracy and efficiency in classroom management.
